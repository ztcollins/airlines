    "There are many airlines that can be taken and many people have opinions on which has the best service. I aim to find out which airline has the best amenities, service, and whether flyers have biases about companies that influence their ratings. I based this problem off the support vectors problem in question 1 of homework 9, but made large changes in the data being evaluating through regression. I wanted to make sure I am using real life data to compare all the airlines and amenities.\n"

I plan on performing this problem multiple times by using three different datasets that will include different factors that influence the 'overall_rating' and 'recommended'. I will perform the first only using the amenities on the ship as influence for 'overall_rating' and 'recommended'. I will then perform the second using only company name as the influence for 'overall_rating' and 'recommended'. Then I will perform the last using both the company name and ship amenities.\n"
