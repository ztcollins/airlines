    "There are many airlines that can be taken and many people have opinions on which has the best service. I aim to look at the average of the data and find out which airline has the best amenities, service, and whether flyers often return to that airline service. I based this problem off the airline problem in question 3 of homework 4, but made large changes in problem structure. I also wanted to make sure I am using real life data to compare all the airlines.\n"

    "The optimization of this problem will be based on creating a parameter equation that assigns each airline a “total value” score and maximizing it. This score will be based on several factors that will positively or negatively affect the parameter equation. I don't think there is an objective way to do this, but it would essentially be using an equation of the user reviews (+/- points if verified user), different amenities (+/- points if airline doesn't have wifi for example), what type of people ride the plane (+/- points if more business people), etc.\n"
